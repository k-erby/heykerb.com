## Making a branch and Pushing/Pulling From It.
Version control is tough. Working on different branches will ensure no one rewrites over someone elses code accidentally. Below are the **terminal commands for branching**.

**Create a branch:**
```
git checkout -b myUserName-featureName
```

When branching, focus on creating small portions of code. Once that code is up and running functionally, commit it. Commit messages detail what you changed/added to the code.

**Commit your changes:**
```
git commit -m "Fixed a stray semicolon - I am a god."
```

**Push your commit to origin:**
```
git push origin myUserName-featureName
```

Now you submit a **pull request**! You may also want to destroy your branch if you're done working on the feature you were implementing.
